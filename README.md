#  House Price Prediction with Simple Machine Learning Model

This project is a **mini project** as a **Machine Learning Engineer for SPARK**. It implements a **simple linear regression model** to predict house prices based on the **square footage of the living area (`sqft_living`)**. The dataset used is from **King County, USA**, which contains historical house sale prices.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**: [House Sales Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- **Features Used**: `sqft_living` (square footage of living area)
- **Target Variable**: `price` (house price in USD)

## ðŸŽ¥ Presentation Video
A presentation video explaining the process can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFiO68DR-nUwR6Oe3YvcMQD0JhCxA7ec/view?usp=drive_link). The explanation is in Indonesian.

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation
- The model is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure prediction accuracy.
